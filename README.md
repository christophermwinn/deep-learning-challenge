# deep-learning-challenge
UTA Data Bootcamp

This is the Module 21- Neural Networks Challenge.  Our goal is to develop an accurate model for 
the nonprofit Alphabet Soup, so it can better predict which projects will be successful, and,
therefore, worthy of funding.

After preparing the data, I ran three models.  These models are contained in the
AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization Jupyter notebook.  The first model is the same as in the original
Jupyter notebook (AlphabetSoupCharity).

Model 1
Accuracy 72.8

Model 2
Reduced epochs to 25
Accuracy 72.8

Model 3
Added 1 hidden layer, changed hidden nodes
Accuracy 72.8

Unfortunately, the model accuracy did not change with these minor adjustments.  Additional 
enhancements would be to change the hidden nodes more significantly, and removing more columns.
The goal of 75% accuracy was not met with these initial models.
